`Forever Scalable`

# Quo

**Quo** is a Python based toolkit for writing Command-Line Interface(CLI) applications.
Quo is making headway towards composing speedy and orderly CLI applications while forestalling any disappointments brought about by the failure to execute a CLI API.
Simple to code, easy to learn, and does not come with needless baggage. 

Quo requires Python `3.8` or later.
