`Forever Scalable`

**Quo** is a Python based toolkit for writing Command-Line Interface(CLI) applications.
Quo is making headway towards composing speedy and orderly CLI applications while forestalling any disappointments brought about by the failure to execute a CLI API.
Simple to code, easy to learn, and does not come with needless baggage. 

## Compatibility
Quo works flawlessly  with Linux, OSX, and Windows.
Quo requires Python `3.8` or later. 


## Features
- [x] Support for Ansi, RGB and HTML color models
- [x] Support for tabular presentation of data
- [x] Interactive progressbars
- [x] Code completions
- [x] Nesting of commands
- [x] Automatic help page generation
- [x] Syntax highlighting
- [x] Autosuggestions
- [x] Key Binders

## Getting Started
### Installation
You can install quo via the Python Package Index (PyPI)

```
pip install -U quo
```


### Quo echo
**Example 1**
```python
   from quo import echo

   echo(f"Hello, World!", fg="red", italic=True, bold=True))
```
![Hello World](https://github.com/secretum-inc/quo/raw/master/pics/print.png)

**Example 2**
```python
   from quo import echo

   echo(f"Quo is ", nl=False)
   echo(f"scalable", bg="red", fg="black") 
```
![Scalable](https://github.com/secretum-inc/quo/raw/master/pics/scalable.png)

Unlike the builtin print function, ``echo`` function has improved support for handling Unicode and binary data.
It also supports handling of ANSI color sequences.

### Quo prompt
```python
   from quo import prompt

   prompt("What is your name?")
```
![quo.prompt](https://github.com/secretum-inc/quo/raw/master/pics/prompt.png)

### quo.Prompt toolbar
```python
   from quo.prompt import Prompt
   
   session = Prompt(bottom_toolbar="Python üêç is great")
   session.prompt("Type something:") 
```
![quo.Prompt.prompt](https://github.com/secretum-inc/quo/raw/master/docs/images/prompt2.png)

### Quo autocompletion
```python
   # Press [Tab] to autocomplete
   from quo.prompt import Prompt
   from quo.completion import WordCompleter

   example = WordCompleter(['USA', 'UK', 'Canada', 'Kenya'])
   session = Prompt(completer=example)
   session.prompt('Which country are you from?: ')
```
![Autocompletion](https://github.com/secretum-inc/quo/raw/master/docs/images/autocompletion.png)

### Using the Console
For more control over quo terminal content, import and construct a [Console](https://quo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/console.html) object.
                                            ```python                                   from quo import Console

console = Console()
```
The Console object has a `print` method which has an intentionally similar interface to the builtin `print` function. Here's an example of use:

### Quo frame
```python
  
   from quo import container
   from quo.widgets import Frame, TextArea

   # Example of a simple layout
   content = TextArea(text="Hello worldüåç")
   container(
        Frame(
            content,
            title="Quo: pythonüêç"))

```
![Frame](https://github.com/secretum-inc/quo/raw/master/docs/images/print_frame.png)

<details>
<summary>Dialog</summary>
High level API for displaying dialog boxes to the user for informational purposes, or get input fromthe user.

Example of a message box dialog.
```python
   from quo import MessageBox

   MessageBox(
           title="Message pop up window",
           text="Do you want to continue?\nPress ENTER to quit.").run()                                       

```
The above produces the following output
![Message Box](https://github.com/secretum-inc/quo/raw/master/docs/images/messagebox.png)

Example of a prompt box dialog
```python
   from quo.dialog import PromptBox

   PromptBox(
             title="PromptBox shenanigans",
             text="What Country are you from?:").run()

```
![Prompt Box](https://github.com/secretum-inc/quo/raw/master/docs/images/promptbox.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Table</summary>
Function [Table](https://quo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/table.html) offers a number of configuration options to set the look and feel of the table, including how borders are rendered and the style and alignment of the columns.

Example
```python
   from quo import echo
   from quo.table import Table

   data = [
     ["Name", "Gender", "Age"],
     ["Alice", "F", 24],
     ["Bob", "M", 19],
     ["Dave", "M", 24]
   ]
   echo(Table(data))
```
