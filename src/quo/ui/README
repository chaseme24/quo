quo.prompt()

Prompts a user for input.  This is a convenience function that can
    be used to prompt a user for input later.
    If the user aborts the input by sending a interrupt signal, this
    function will catch it and raise a :exc:`Abort` exception.
    :param text: the text to show for the prompt.
    :param default: the default value to use if no input happens.  If this
                    is not given it will prompt until it's aborted.
    :param hide_input: if this is set to true then the input value will
                       be hidden.
    :param confirmation_prompt: asks for confirmation for the value.
    :param type: the type to use to check the value against.
    :param value_proc: if this parameter is provided it's a function that
                       is invoked instead of the type conversion to
                       convert a value.
    :param prompt_suffix: a suffix that should be added to the prompt.
    :param show_default: shows or hides the default value in the prompt.
    :param err: if set to true the file defaults to ``stderr`` instead of
                ``stdout``, the same as with echo.
    :param show_choices: Show or hide choices if the passed type is a Choice.
                         For example if type is a Choice of either day or week,
                         show_choices is true and text is "Group by" then the
                         prompt will be "Group by (day, week): ".
